      <h1>🎉 Happy Birthday, Riaz! 🎂</h1>
      <p>Today we celebrate *you* and all your awesomeness!
        Today, we’re celebrating you, and honestly, you give me so many reasons to celebrate. (Check the list if you need a reminder 😉.)

I pray Allah blesses you with health, wealth, and success in both dunya and akhirah. May He guide and protect you, and make all your dreams come true in the best way, Insha’Allah. You’ve already made such a positive impact in my life, and I know this year will bring even more amazing moments for you.

JazakAllah for being the incredible person you are. I’m lucky to have you by my side, and I can’t wait to keep making memories together. Let’s make this year unforgettable!🎉

        <h2>Why You're Amazing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You’re super mature (most of the time 😉).</li>
          <li>You’ve got this sixth sense for when I’m stressed—are you secretly a mind reader?</li>
          <li>You’re basically my inner child’s therapist.</li>
          <li>You always hype me up to focus on my goals (even when I’d rather nap).</li>
          <li>Life with you is never boring—adventure level: 100.</li>
          <li>You know how to make me feel loved, even when you’re teasing me like a baby.</li>
          <li>Our convos? Pure gold. Who else can send me 26-minute voice notes?</li>
          <li>You’re hustling hard, and I love your ambition.</li>
          <li>I trust you more than my SPF 50, and that’s saying a lot.</li>
          <li>You handle life’s curveballs like a pro (and still look good doing it).</li>
          <li>Your perfectionist side keeps us both aiming for the stars.</li>
          <li>You make me feel like the luckiest person ever, even when you’re indecisive about food.</li>
        </ul>
